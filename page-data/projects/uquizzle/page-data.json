This drive, combined with an unforgettable hackathon experience, led to the creation of UQuizzle – a Chrome extension that transforms how students interact with lecture recordings on Echo360.</p>\n<h2>The Birth of UQuizzle</h2>\n<p>When we walked into the UQCS Hackathon 2024, we had nothing but enthusiasm and empty notebooks. No predetermined ideas, just a shared passion for creating something meaningful. The first night was filled with intense brainstorming sessions as we sought to identify a problem worth solving. As students ourselves, we kept coming back to a common pain point: the challenge of going to lectures, staying engaged with lecture recordings and effectively retaining information.</p>\n<p>The idea for UQuizzle emerged from our collective experiences. We knew that for our project to succeed, it needed to be both innovative and feasible within the hackathon's time constraints. After thorough feasibility checks and technical discussions, we committed to our vision to build an AI-powered tool that would make lecture recordings more interactive and engaging.</p>\n<p>What followed were intense, sleepless nights on campus. Our diverse team – myself, Ammar, Azra, Matthew, and Syafiqo – worked tirelessly, each bringing our unique strengths to the table. The supportive atmosphere of the hackathon, combined with our determination, pushed us through the challenging moments. These experience became some of our most memorable university experiences.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"margin: 0 auto; text-align: center; width:100%;\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 650px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/54120061313e523b5f1882793e5b5591/e1596/expo.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.87116564417178%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Our Booth\"\n        title=\"Our Booth\"\n        src=\"/static/54120061313e523b5f1882793e5b5591/6aca1/expo.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/54120061313e523b5f1882793e5b5591/d2f63/expo.jpg 163w,\n/static/54120061313e523b5f1882793e5b5591/c989d/expo.jpg 325w,\n/static/54120061313e523b5f1882793e5b5591/6aca1/expo.jpg 650w,\n/static/54120061313e523b5f1882793e5b5591/7c09c/expo.jpg 975w,\n/static/54120061313e523b5f1882793e5b5591/01ab0/expo.jpg 1300w,\n/static/54120061313e523b5f1882793e5b5591/e1596/expo.jpg 2048w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">Our Booth</figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<p>UQuizzle seamlessly integrates with Echo360's video player, transforming passive video watching into an active learning experience. At its core, the extension provides intelligent quiz generation, analyzing lecture content in real-time to create relevant multiple-choice questions. Each question includes a timestamp link, enabling students to jump directly to the relevant part of the lecture for review.</p>\n<p>We didn't stop at quizzes. Our AI-powered system converts lecture content into concise, downloadable notes, saving students valuable time while ensuring they don't miss crucial information. The system provides personalized performance analytics, offering topic-by-topic strength analysis and tailored improvement recommendations.</p>\n<p>Building UQuizzle presented unique technical challenges. We chose JavaScript as our primary technology, integrating it with OpenAI's API for content analysis and generation.</p>\n<h2>Impact and Recognition</h2>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"margin: 0 auto; text-align: center; width:100%;\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 650px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/84445c724e8495e3a285b189c96d6beb/e1596/presentation.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.87116564417178%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Presentation and Q&amp;A\"\n        title=\"Presentation and Q&amp;A\"\n        src=\"/static/84445c724e8495e3a285b189c96d6beb/6aca1/presentation.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/84445c724e8495e3a285b189c96d6beb/d2f63/presentation.jpg 163w,\n/static/84445c724e8495e3a285b189c96d6beb/c989d/presentation.jpg 325w,\n/static/84445c724e8495e3a285b189c96d6beb/6aca1/presentation.jpg 650w,\n/static/84445c724e8495e3a285b189c96d6beb/7c09c/presentation.jpg 975w,\n/static/84445c724e8495e3a285b189c96d6beb/01ab0/presentation.jpg 1300w,\n/static/84445c724e8495e3a285b189c96d6beb/e1596/presentation.jpg 2048w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">Presentation and Q&amp;A</figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<p>Our hard work paid off in ways we never expected.
