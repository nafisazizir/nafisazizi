## **Introduction**

In a world where technology is constantly evolving, the way we book movie tickets should be just as advanced and convenient. This was the inspiration behind SEA Cinema, a one-stop movie booking app designed to simplify the process of booking tickets, browsing movies, and enhancing the overall cinema experience. Developed using React and TypeScript, SEA Cinema aims to bring a seamless movie-going experience to users everywhere.

## **Development Process**

The journey of creating SEA Cinema was both challenging and rewarding. The development process was divided into several key phases, each bringing its own set of lessons and insights.

### **Planning and Ideation**

The project began with careful planning and ideation. I outlined the core features of the app, focusing on making it user-friendly and efficient. The goal was to create an intuitive platform that allows users to effortlessly browse movies, select showtimes, choose seats, and book tickets—all from the palm of their hand. I also wanted to eliminate the hassle of carrying cash, introducing a user balance feature for seamless transactions.

### **Implementation**

The implementation phase involved coding the app using React and TypeScript. I paid close attention to the user experience, ensuring that the interface was clean and easy to navigate. Here are some of the key pages and features I developed:

### Registration

- Users could create accounts by providing their username, password, name, and age.
- I implemented checks to ensure that each username was unique in the system.

### Login

- Registered users could log in using their username and password, gaining access to the app's full features.

### The Movie

- Everyone had access to view all available movies, complete with details such as the title, description, age rating, poster, and ticket price.

### The User’s Balance

- Only logged-in users could top up or withdraw their balance, enhancing the convenience of cashless transactions.
- Each registered user had their own balance, and I set limits on both top-up and withdrawal amounts to ensure responsible use.

### The Ticket

- Logged-in users could book tickets, view their transaction history, and cancel ticket transactions.
- Users could select available seats, with a maximum of 64 seats per showtime, and the system ensured that each seat could only be booked once.
- I implemented logic to limit the maximum number of tickets that could be booked in one transaction to six.
- Payment was deducted from the user's balance, and transactions were only successful if the balance was sufficient.
- Age restrictions were enforced to ensure that users below the movie's age rating couldn't proceed with the transaction.
- Canceled ticket transactions automatically refunded the money to the user's balance, making it a hassle-free process.

## **Lessons Learned**

Throughout the development of SEA Cinema, we learned valuable lessons that extend beyond just coding:

1. **User-Centric Approach:** Prioritizing user experience and convenience is paramount. Our design decisions were heavily influenced by what would make the app easier and more enjoyable for users.
2. **Security and Validation:** Ensuring data integrity and security was a top concern. Validating user inputs, implementing authentication mechanisms, and safeguarding financial transactions were critical aspects of the project.
3. **Scalability:** As the user base grows, the app must remain scalable. I architected the codebase to accommodate potential future enhancements and increased demand.
4. **Continuous Improvement:** Technology evolves rapidly. It's essential to stay updated with the latest trends and regularly update the app to provide a fresh and engaging experience.

## **Conclusion**

SEA Cinema, or SEANEMEA, has been a labor of love—a project aimed at making movie booking a breeze. It's a testament to the power of technology in simplifying everyday tasks and enhancing our lives. As we move forward, we are excited to see how SEA Cinema evolves and continues to delight users, providing them with unforgettable movie experiences. Whether you're a movie enthusiast or just looking for a hassle-free way to enjoy a film, SEA Cinema is your one-stop movie companion. Say goodbye to long queues and cash payments—say hello to convenience and entertainment at your fingertips.
