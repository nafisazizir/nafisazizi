# **Inspiration**

As college students, we often like to seek guidance as we further progress into becoming a part of society. To find and have impactful and meaningful conversations amongst those with similar interests. Being able to freely ask and express ourselves without being judged for it.

Young minds in Indonesia are brimming with potential, dreams, and aspirations, yet they often find themselves searching for a space where they can freely express their thoughts, seek guidance, and engage in conversations that truly matter. Current social platforms offer means of communication, but they lack the essential elements necessary to cultivate an environment conducive to meaningful interactions especially one focused on us as the youths of Indonesia. This absence of a safe and inclusive space hinders the growth of young individuals, leaving them feeling isolated and disconnected.

This further inspires us and fueled our motivation to bring this platform to fruition through "Peopl.". Breaking boundaries through limitless anonymous interactions with youth-catered communities emphasizing on their inevitable development to society.

# **What it does**

"Peopl." is your ultimate online discussion forum for youth empowerment‼️ We provide a safe and supportive space for healthy discussions and skill growth. At "Peopl.", everyone can freely engage in anonymous discussions, empowering individuals to express their opinions without fear of judgment or ridicule. But it doesn't end there! In addition to public discussions, "Peopl." also offers personalized matchmaking for more tailored and intimate conversations with like-minded youths. "Peopl." is more than a platform; it's a movement empowering youth to become active architects of their future, all while leaving a positive mark on society. In "Peopl.", you can be a part of a vibrant community that fosters personal growth, collaboration, and positive change. Empower yourself and others at "Peopl."!

# **How we built it**

First, as a team, we discussed and brainstormed our ideas on youth empowerment. After that, we decided on an idea that was not only great but doable to implement in the span of 36 hours or less. We then divide our team into roles: UI/UX Designer, Frontend Developer, and Backend Developer. The UI/UX Designer first uses the design thinking process to find the best way to deliver our solution to our users and address their pain points. They then designed the Hi-Fi wireframes for each page; after completing a page, the wireframe for the page is provided to the frontend and backend developers to develop. The development was done in parallel between the front and backend. However, the repository for each is separated. The frontend uses Typescript and Tailwind CSS as the primary tech stack, while the backend uses Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. Each developer works on a separate branch; after completing, they will make a pull request for that branch to the main branch. After that, they integrate each side to form a working page.

# **Challenges we ran into**

As with all tech projects, we've stumbled into a few challenges along the way. One we'd like to share is during the ideation phase, we wanted to make the experience as unique as possible for our users and to provide helpful features for youths trying to gain their footing in the world. We came into a few blockers, discussing with each other and asking students like us their pain points when figuring their way through society and developing their skills. The different challenge is, of course, more technical. To challenge us and up our game, there were many new tools and languages just introduced to us that we learned along the way for this hackathon. While challenging, we also saw this as an opportunity to learn something new and gain a new skill once the hackathon ends.

# **Accomplishments that we're proud of**

As this is our first hackathon, we believe that it is a huge achievement for us to be able to ideate a solution that has the capability to bring impact to the youth of Indonesia and create a deliverable within a timeframe of 36 hours. It was a journey of teamwork, pushing our limits, and embracing innovation. Whatever the outcome may be, we're proud to be able to participate in this hackathon and explore things outside our comfort zone.

# **What we learned**

As we delve deeper into our ideation phase of the project, we've become more aware of a long-standing problem that plagues us as youths in Indonesia. That is the need for more support or a platform that fosters healthy, empowering, and impactful discussions within our youth communities. The hackathon also provided us with valuable opportunities to learn new technical skills and expand our tech stack.

# **What's next for Peopl.**

As for "Peopl.", we wish to explore this idea further. We believe that the concept of "Peopl." can impact our youth much further. That's why we aim to build the community further and spread the word to make "Peopl." bigger and gain more support from young Indonesians wishing to find a safe space to discuss and explore. Alongside that, we also want to research further on how we can improve the idea and address pain points from that we have yet to discover to increase our impact and experience for our users.
