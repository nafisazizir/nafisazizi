Hey there! I'm Nafis Azizi Riza, a CS student with a passion for Software Engineering, and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Currently I'm pursuing a [double degree program](https://cs.ui.ac.id/sarjana-ilmu-komputer-kelas-internasional/) both in Bachelor of Computer Science at University of Indonesia, and [The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia](https://www.uq.edu.au/). I've been diving deep into various subjects like, algorithms, statistics, and database. As an exchange student at theÂ [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/gro/global-programmes/student-exchange/incoming-exchangers), I had the opportunity to expand my knowledge further, deepen my cross cultural understanding, and of course travelled South East Asia with fellow exchangers. It was the greatest time with the greatest people!

I've been gaining some practical experiences through internship and hackathons, and a handful of successful projects. Outside of CS related stuff, I enjoy spending some time doing outdoor activities, and hop on adventures. 

This website is a mixed place where I get to showcase my projects, experiences, and everything I've been up to! Consider it my own little playground of creativity and innovation. Here, you'll find a collection of the cool stuff I've done in the past, what I'm currently working on, and even get a glimpse into where I'm headed next. It's like a virtual playground where I bring my ideas to life and share them with the world. So come on in, take a look around, and let's dive into this exciting journey together!
