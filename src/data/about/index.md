Hey there! I'm Nafis Azizi Riza, a computer science enthusiast with a passion for coding and problem-solving. Currently, I'm pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Universitas Indonesia, where I've been diving deep into various subjects like, algorithms, statistics, and database. As an exchange student at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/gro/global-programmes/student-exchange/incoming-exchangers), I had the opportunity to expand my knowledge further, deepen my cross cultural understanding, and of course travelled South East Asia with fellow exchangers. It was the greatest time with the greatest people!

In Universitas Indonesia, I am participating in a [double degree program](https://cs.ui.ac.id/sarjana-ilmu-komputer-kelas-internasional/) which I will be continuing the rest of my study in [University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia](https://www.uq.edu.au/) starting from February 2024. This will be the third country for my undergraduate journey and am very looking forward to it.

When it comes to programming, I'm versatile with languages like Python, Java, Kotlin and C++. I'm also well-versed in the realm of software development, data analysis & AI/ML. From TensorFlow and PyTorch to Flutter and React, I love utilizing the right tools and frameworks to bring ideas to life.

I'm proud to have been a finalist in the Information Technology Business Competition, Gemastik 2022, and a recipient of the UI RISE Scholarship. These experiences have further fueled my drive to continuously learn, grow, and make a positive impact in the world of technology.

This website is a mixed place where I get to showcase my projects, experiences, and everything I've been up to! Consider it my own little playground of creativity and innovation. Here, you'll find a collection of the cool stuff I've done in the past, what I'm currently working on, and even get a glimpse into where I'm headed next. It's like a virtual playground where I bring my ideas to life and share them with the world. So come on in, take a look around, and let's dive into this exciting journey together!
